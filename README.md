/plugin marketplace add AltayTech/gamestudio-subagents

# Install the plugin
/plugin install gamestudio
```

### Option 2: Direct GitHub Install

```bash
/plugin add AltayTech/gamestudio-subagents
```

### Option 3: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AltayTech/gamestudio-subagents.git

# Copy the plugin files to your project
cp -r gamestudio-subagents/.claude-plugin your-project/
cp -r gamestudio-subagents/commands your-project/.claude/
cp -r gamestudio-subagents/agents-plugin your-project/.claude/agents/

# Or install globally for all projects
cp -r gamestudio-subagents/.claude-plugin ~/.claude/
cp -r gamestudio-subagents/commands ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r gamestudio-subagents/agents-plugin ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Using the Plugin

Once installed, use the slash commands:

```bash
# Start a new game project
/new-game

### 5 Specialized Agents

| Agent | Role | Expertise |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **🎨 game-design** | Vision & Features | GDD, mechanics, content design, user stories |
| **⚙️ game-dev** | Implementation | Core systems, game feel, optimization, code |
| **🖼️ game-art** | Visual Direction | Art style, shaders, UI/UX, accessibility |
| **📈 market-intel** | Market & Analytics | Competitors, metrics, A/B testing, projections |
| **🐛 qa** | Quality Assurance | Testing, bugs, performance, release validation |

### 4 Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/new-game` | Initialize a new game project |
| `/design` | Enter design phase - documentation focus |
| `/prototype` | Rapid proof of concept development |
| `/develop` | Full production pipeline |

## 📚 How It Works

### 1. Project Initialization
The system starts with market validation, then project setup:
- **Market Analysis**: Competitive research and opportunity assessment
- **Project Setup**: Organized folders and agent configuration  
- **Documentation**: Templates and milestone schedules
- **Analytics Setup**: Telemetry and metrics planning

### 1.5. Development Rules Configuration
During initialization, you can define custom development rules:
- **Coding Standards**: Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, KISS principles
- **Architecture Patterns**: MVC, ECS, State Machines, etc.
- **Performance Requirements**: FPS targets, memory limits
- **Project-Specific Rules**: Any custom standards for your team

All rules are stored in `project-config.json` and enforced by the Producer Agent throughout development.

### 2. Development Modes

#### 🎨 Design Mode
Perfect for exploring ideas without committing to development:
- **Market Validation**: Competitive analysis and target audience research
- **Design Documentation**: Complete game design with data backing
- **Art Direction**: Style exploration based on market research
- **Technical Assessment**: Multi-engine feasibility analysis

#### 🚧 Prototype Mode
Quickly validate your core gameplay:
- **Market-Informed Design**: Based on competitive analysis
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Core mechanics with telemetry
- **Data Collection**: Player behavior and engagement metrics
- **Performance Validation**: Technical and market viability

#### 🎮 Development Mode
Full production pipeline with all agents:
- **Data-Driven Development**: Analytics throughout production
- **Market-Aware Implementation**: Features based on competitive research
- **Continuous Optimization**: A/B testing and performance monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: QA with telemetry integration

### 3. Agent Coordination
Agents communicate through structured protocols:
```
User → Master Orchestrator → Market Analysis → Producer → Specialized Agents → Data Collection → Optimization
```

7. **Design Agents**: Create game systems with market insights
8. **Art Agents**: Develop visuals based on competitive analysis  
9. **Engineering Agents**: Build mechanics with telemetry integration
10. **QA Agent**: Tests with performance monitoring

#### **Phase 4: Continuous Optimization** 📈
11. **Data Collection**: Real-time metrics from all development phases
12. **Analysis Loop**: Data Scientist analyzes, Market Analyst validates, Producer optimizes
13. **Iteration**: Teams adjust based on data insights

#### **Phase 5: Launch & Beyond** 🚀
14. **Market-Ready Release**: Launched with proven data backing
15. **Post-Launch Monitoring**: Continuous analytics and optimization
16. **Long-term Success**: Data-driven updates and improvements

## 📁 Project Management

# ✨ Automatically configures for your chosen engine (Godot/Unity/Unreal)
# ✨ Creates engine-specific folder structure
# ✨ Generates project-specific agents with engine expertise
```

### Project Management Commands
```bash
# Show all projects
python scripts/project_manager.py status

# Show specific project details
python scripts/project_manager.py status my-game

# Resume work on a project
python scripts/project_manager.py resume my-game
